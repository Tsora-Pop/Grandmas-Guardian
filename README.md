<H1> Grandma's Guardian</H1>

A extension to protect your grandma, grandpa, or anyone! Introducing "Grandma's Guardian", a security tool you can setup for yourself or a loved one to reduce the likelihood they become victims of an online scam. Simply Install, add your top 20, delete any domains you know the user or yourself won't need, and safely browse! This is not intended as an Ad blocker, as advertisements will load on the web page. Best of all: Absolutely no data is collected on you by the developers. We just want you to empower family to be as safe as possible online. This extension will work on any Chromium based browser. Firefox support coming soon (and mobile Firefox supports extensions well).
